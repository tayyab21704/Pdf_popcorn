 Overview
The PDF Podcast Project converts any PDF document into an audio podcast-style narration, allowing users to consume text-based content hands-free.
It uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to produce a smooth, human-like reading experience.

Key Idea:
Transform lengthy reading materials like research papers, reports, or e-books into an engaging listening experience â€” perfect for multitasking or accessibility.

PDF Podcast Generator â€” A tool that converts written documents into engaging, natural-sounding audio podcasts. It takes PDF files as input, extracts and processes the text, then uses text-to-speech technology to produce clear, well-paced audio. Designed for accessibility and convenience, it enables users to listen to reports, books, or study material on the go, turning static documents into a dynamic listening experience.
